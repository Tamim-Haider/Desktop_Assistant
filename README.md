# Desktop_Assistant
A Python-based desktop voice assistant that listens to voice commands and performs automated tasks. It uses speech recognition to understand user input and executes system-level actions, making desktop interaction faster, smarter, and hands-free.

This project is a Python-based desktop assistant that responds to voice commands and performs user-requested tasks automatically. The assistant listens to spoken input, processes it using speech recognition, and executes predefined actions to simplify daily desktop operations.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how voice interaction, automation, and system control can be combined into a practical desktop application using Python.

🔹 Key Features

🎙️ Voice Command Recognition – Understands and processes spoken instructions

⚙️ Task Automation – Executes system-level and application-specific tasks

🧠 Command Processing Logic – Matches user commands with predefined actions

🖥️ Desktop Integration – Interacts directly with the operating system

🔊 Audio Feedback – Provides voice or text responses for better user interaction

🔹 Technologies Used

Python as the core programming language

Speech Recognition for capturing voice commands

Text-to-Speech (TTS) for assistant responses

OS & Automation Libraries for task execution

🔹 Use Cases

Opening applications or files

Performing system operations via voice

Automating repetitive desktop tasks

Learning and experimenting with AI-based assistants

🔹 Learning Outcomes
